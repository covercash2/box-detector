A simple prototype for an object detection app.
The app should be a single Activity/screen that displays a camera viewport with graphical overlays for object detection.

## Image detection with Tensorflow lite

This app uses Tensorflow 2.0 to generate a model that is encoded as a Tensorflow lite model to be used on mobile (specifically Android for now).
