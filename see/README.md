# ML Kit Vision Quickstart Sample App

## Introduction

The ML Kit Quickstart app was copied for this project.

## Feature List

* [Object Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/object-detection/android) - Detect, track, and classify objects in real time

## Getting Started

* Run the sample code on your Android device or emulator
* Make sure the build variant is set to "debug" or Android Studio will report a signing error

## How to use the app

This app opens up to a CameraX live viewport with Object Detection.

### CameraX Live Preview scenario
The CameraX live preview scenario is very similar to the native live camera scenario, but instead relies on CameraX live preview. Note: CameraX is only supported on API level 21+.
